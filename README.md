#Welcome to the student portal

I created this application to learn how to use backend libriaries. The goal is to create a CRUD application. The focus is to read, create, update, and delete a student. 
The goal is to eventually connect this student portal with the comments generator. 

At the moment a user can login and logout of the app. A user can also create an account. However, I am having issues with adding a student to the STUDENTS array.
